Lecture - Running First Container

This document provides a list of basic Docker CLI commands used in the lecture.
Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory that contains your Dockerfile and run:

docker build -t telusko/rest-demo:v3 .

    This builds a Docker image named telusko/rest-demo with tag v3 using the current directory (.) as the build context.

List Available Docker Images

docker images

Run the Docker Image with Port Mapping

docker run -p 8081:8081 telusko/rest-demo:v3

Container & Image Lifecycle Commands

List All Containers

docker ps -a

Delete a container

docker rm <container_id>

List All Images

docker images

Delete an image

docker rmi <image_id>

Key Note:

    Every time you run a Docker container, a new container ID is generated.
    A container must be removed first before its corresponding image can be deleted.

Step-by-Step: Docker Workflow

1. Search for Images on Docker Hub

docker search <image_name>

2. Pull an image from Docker Hub

docker pull <image_name>

3. Check Containers (None Created Yet)

docker ps -a

4. Create a Container from the Image

docker create <image_name>

5. Verify Container is Created

docker ps -a

6. Start the Container

docker start <container_id>

    Either the container_id or the container_name can be used.

7. Confirm Container is Running

docker ps -a

8. Pause the Container (Optional)

docker pause <container_id>

9. Stop the container

docker stop <container_id>

10. Remove the container

docker rm <container_id>

11. Verify Container is Removed

docker ps -a 

Lecture - Docker Compose

This document provides a list of basic Docker CLI commands used in the lecture.
Clean and Package the Application

Use Maven to clean and create a JAR package of the Spring Boot project:

mvn clean package

Build and Start Docker Containers

Use Docker Compose to build the images and start the containers:

docker-compose up --build

    This will use the docker-compose.yml file to build the application.

docker images

Lecture - Running SpringBoot App on Docker

This document provides a list of basic Docker CLI commands used in the lecture.
Check Running Containers

docker ps

List All Files in the Container (JDK Environment)

docker exec <container_name> ls -a

    Lists all folders and files in the container's root directory.

Check Contents of /tmp Directory

docker exec <container_name> ls /tmp

    It will contain only one file in /tmp at the initial stage.

Copy the Spring Boot JAR File into the Container

docker cp target/rest-demo.jar <container_name>:/tmp

    This copies the rest-demo.jar into the container’s /tmp directory.

Verify the JAR File is Present

docker exec <container_name> ls /tmp

    The rest-demo.jar file will be available in addition to the existing content.

Commit the Container to Create a New Docker Image

docker commit <container_name> telusko/rest-demo:v1

    Creates a new Docker image named telusko/rest-demo with tag v1 from the current container state.

List Docker Images

docker images

    Verifies that telusko/rest-demo:v1 image has been created successfully.

Default Behavior: JShell

When running telusko/rest-demo:v1, the container defaults to JShell:

docker run telusko/rest-demo:v1

Set Default Command to Run JAR Using --change

To override the default JShell behavior, the --change flag is used while committing:

docker commit --change='CMD ["java", "-jar", "/tmp/rest-demo.jar"]' <container_name> telusko/rest-demo:v2

    This sets the default command to run the JAR directly when the image is run.

Run the Updated Image (v2)

docker run telusko/rest-demo:v2

    This will now run the Spring Boot application from the JAR instead of entering JShell.

Map Ports While Running the Container

docker run -p 8081:8081 telusko/rest-demo:v2

    Maps port 8081 of the container to 8081 on the host machine.
