Lecture - Running SpringBoot App on Docker

This document provides a list of basic Docker CLI commands used in the lecture.
Check Running Containers

docker ps

List All Files in the Container (JDK Environment)

docker exec <container_name> ls -a

    Lists all folders and files in the container's root directory.

Check Contents of /tmp Directory

docker exec <container_name> ls /tmp

    It will contain only one file in /tmp at the initial stage.

Copy the Spring Boot JAR File into the Container

docker cp target/rest-demo.jar <container_name>:/tmp

    This copies the rest-demo.jar into the container’s /tmp directory.

Verify the JAR File is Present

docker exec <container_name> ls /tmp

    The rest-demo.jar file will be available in addition to the existing content.

Commit the Container to Create a New Docker Image

docker commit <container_name> telusko/rest-demo:v1

    Creates a new Docker image named telusko/rest-demo with tag v1 from the current container state.

List Docker Images

docker images

    Verifies that telusko/rest-demo:v1 image has been created successfully.

Default Behavior: JShell

When running telusko/rest-demo:v1, the container defaults to JShell:

docker run telusko/rest-demo:v1

Set Default Command to Run JAR Using --change

To override the default JShell behavior, the --change flag is used while committing:

docker commit --change='CMD ["java", "-jar", "/tmp/rest-demo.jar"]' <container_name> telusko/rest-demo:v2

    This sets the default command to run the JAR directly when the image is run.

Run the Updated Image (v2)

docker run telusko/rest-demo:v2

    This will now run the Spring Boot application from the JAR instead of entering JShell.

Map Ports While Running the Container

docker run -p 8081:8081 telusko/rest-demo:v2

    Maps port 8081 of the container to 8081 on the host machine.
