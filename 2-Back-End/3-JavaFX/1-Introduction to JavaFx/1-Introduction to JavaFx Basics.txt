JavaFX Overview
JavaFX is a set of graphics and user interface (UI) tools that enables developers to create rich internet applications (RIAs) and desktop applications. It provides a unified platform for building user interfaces for desktop, mobile, and embedded systems. JavaFX is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and aims to replace Swing, the older Java GUI library, providing enhanced graphics capabilities, modern UI controls, and better performance.

JavaFX Stages and Levels
JavaFX applications are typically structured using a Stage and Scene model:

Stage: The stage represents a window in JavaFX, similar to a frame in Swing. It is a top-level container for UI elements.

The Stage class is used to create a window.
Each JavaFX application has one primary stage (although you can have additional stages).
Scene: A scene is a container for all the content inside a window (stage). It holds the UI elements (called nodes) like buttons, labels, images, and shapes.

The scene is associated with the stage and is used to define the layout of the application.
Scenes are switched dynamically, allowing different "views" or content to be displayed in the same window.
Levels: JavaFX provides different levels of abstraction for building and interacting with UIs:

Node Level: All visual elements (shapes, controls, images, etc.) are represented as nodes. Nodes are the basic building blocks of a scene.
Layout Level: JavaFX includes various layout managers (like VBox, HBox, GridPane) to arrange the nodes in a UI.
Application Level: The application level is where JavaFX applications are defined, typically starting with a class that extends Application and overrides its start() method to set up the UI.
History of JavaFX
Before JavaFX:

Before JavaFX, the main libraries used to create GUI applications in Java were:

Swing: Introduced in Java 1.2 (1998), Swing provided a lightweight UI toolkit, offering components like buttons, labels, text fields, and more. It was built on top of AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and aimed to be platform-independent and more flexible than AWT. However, Swing's design was somewhat outdated by the 2000s and lacked the modern features needed for richer applications.

AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit): AWT was the first Java UI toolkit, introduced in the early versions of Java. However, AWT was limited in functionality and suffered from performance issues, particularly in terms of appearance, as it used native system components. It also lacked the flexibility and ease of use that Swing later provided.

Other Tools: There were also various third-party libraries (like JFreeChart, JIDE, and others) that helped developers create specialized UIs, but they were often not integrated into the core Java framework.

Introduction of JavaFX:

2007: JavaFX was initially introduced by Sun Microsystems under the name JavaFX Script. It was intended to simplify the development of rich media applications with a scripting language designed for UI creation.
2008: The first version of JavaFX (JavaFX 1.0) was released. Initially, it included JavaFX Script, but the language was not well-received and was eventually deprecated in favor of pure Java integration.
2011: Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and began to shift JavaFX towards a more Java-centric development model. JavaFX 2.0 was released in this period, eliminating JavaFX Script and making JavaFX purely Java-based.
2017: Oracle announced that JavaFX would be decoupled from the JDK in JDK 9. It was then maintained as a separate module, with more community-driven development, leading to its current state.
JavaFX has continued to evolve, with improvements to its performance, new controls, graphics capabilities, and support for modern hardware acceleration.

Key Features of JavaFX
Modern UI Controls: JavaFX includes rich and flexible UI components like buttons, sliders, tables, and charts. It also supports custom UI controls.

CSS Styling: JavaFX allows developers to style UI components using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), similar to how web pages are styled. This provides a clean separation between design and logic.

Graphics and Multimedia: JavaFX includes support for 2D and 3D graphics, allowing developers to build games and other graphic-intensive applications. It also supports audio and video playback.

FXML: JavaFX allows developers to use FXML, an XML-based language to define the UI layout, separating the presentation from the logic (similar to HTML for web apps).

Cross-Platform: JavaFX applications can run on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded systems.

Animation and Effects: JavaFX includes tools for creating animations and applying visual effects, which make it easy to develop dynamic UIs.

JavaFX vs. Swing
JavaFX was introduced to address some limitations of Swing:

Performance: JavaFX uses hardware-accelerated graphics for better performance, especially in rendering complex graphics and animations, while Swing relies on the CPU, which can be slower for modern applications.
Design and Style: JavaFX was built with modern design principles in mind, offering better flexibility and integration with CSS for styling, unlike Swing.
3D Graphics: JavaFX has built-in support for 3D graphics, which was not natively available in Swing.
Conclusion
JavaFX is a modern GUI framework that offers developers the tools needed to create sophisticated, visually appealing, and cross-platform applications. It was introduced to overcome the shortcomings of Swing and AWT, providing better performance, a modern design, and enhanced capabilities for multimedia and graphics. Although it has faced some shifts in its history, JavaFX continues to be an important part of Java's rich ecosystem.
