Here's a detailed comparison between Java, C++, and JavaScript based on key aspects:

Feature				Java ðŸŸ¡				C++ ðŸ”µ				JavaScript ðŸŸ¢
Paradigm		Object-Oriented, High-Level	Object-Oriented, Procedural	Event-Driven, Functional, Object-Based
Compilation		Compiled to Bytecode (JVM)	Compiled to Machine Code	Interpreted (JIT in modern engines)
Execution		Runs on JVM (Cross-platform)	Runs directly on OS		Runs in Browsers (Node.js for backend)
Performance		Slower than C++ (due to JVM)	Fast (Direct machine execution)	Slower (Interpreted nature)
Memory Management	Automatic (Garbage Collector)	Manual (Pointers, Memory Allocation)	Automatic (Garbage Collector)
Platform		Cross-platform (JVM)		OS-Specific Executables		Cross-platform (Browser & Node.js)
Usage			Enterprise, Android Apps,       System Software, Game Dev,	Web Development, Frontend, Backend (Node.js)
			Web Backend			High-Performance Apps
Syntax Complexity	Moderate			Complex (Pointers, Manual Memory)	Simple & Dynamic
Multithreading		Built-in support		Complex (Manual Implementation) Asynchronous (Event-Driven)
Security		More Secure (No Pointers, Sandboxing)	Less Secure (Direct Memory Access)	Secure (Runs in Browser Sandbox)
Example Usage		Web Apps, Android, Enterprise Software	OS, Game Dev (Unreal Engine), Embedded Systems	Web Development, Frontend, Full-Stack
ðŸ”¥ Key Differences:
C++ is fastest but requires manual memory management.
Java is cross-platform due to JVM but slower than C++.
JavaScript is for web development and is the easiest to learn.
