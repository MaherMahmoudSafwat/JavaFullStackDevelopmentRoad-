Entities:

    DEPARTMENT (DepartmentID, Name, Location)

    EQUIPMENT (EquipmentID, Name, Type, Status)

    REPAIRING_REQUEST (RequestID, DateReceived, Description, EquipmentID)

    OPERATING_COMMAND (CommandID, RequestID, DepartmentID, CommandDetails, CommandDate)

Relationships with Cardinality Ratios:

    EQUIPMENT (1) â€”â€” (0..N) REPAIRING_REQUEST

        One equipment can have many repairing requests. Each request is for one equipment.

    REPAIRING_REQUEST (1) â€”â€” (0..N) OPERATING_COMMAND

        One repairing request can generate multiple operating commands.

    DEPARTMENT (1) â€”â€” (0..N) OPERATING_COMMAND

        One department can receive many operating commands. Each command is handled by one department.

There are multiple interpretations since constraints are partially specified â€” but letâ€™s outline them:

    Entities: Lecturer, Course

    Relationship: Teaches

    Degree: Binary (2)

    Membership Class:

        Lecturer: (0..1), (1), or (1)

        Course: (1)

        For example, if itâ€™s "exactly one course per lecturer and exactly one lecturer per course", then itâ€™s (1)â€”(1) relationship.

Possible options based on wording:

    Lecturer (0..1) â€” (1) Course

    Lecturer (1) â€” (1) Course

Weâ€™d need exact wording for "at most," "at least," or "exactly" from the question to pick one.

h)

    Entities: FlightLeg, Airport

    Relationship: Connects

    Degree: Binary (2)

    Membership Class:

        FlightLeg (1) â€” (2) Airport (origin & destination)

        Airport (1) â€” (0..N) FlightLeg

    Here, a FlightLeg connects exactly two airports (origin and destination), and each airport is associated with many flight legs.
