Database Concepts Explained Simply (With Examples)
1. Functional Dependency (FD)

Definition:
When the value of one attribute (column) determines the value of another attribute in the same table.
Example:
StudentID	Name	Age
101	Alice	20
102	Bob	22

    StudentID → Name, Age

        If you know StudentID, you can find Name and Age.

    Name ↛ Age

        Two students named "Alice" could have different ages → No FD.

2. Normalization (Reducing Redundancy)
Types of Normalization:
1NF (First Normal Form)

Rule:

    Each column must have single, atomic values (no lists).

    No repeating groups.

Example (Bad):
OrderID	Products
1	Pen, Pencil, Eraser	(Violates 1NF)

Fix (Good):
OrderID	Product
1	Pen
1	Pencil
2NF (Second Normal Form)

Rule:

    Must be in 1NF + no partial dependency (non-key columns depend on the entire primary key).

Example (Bad):
OrderID	ProductID	ProductName
1	P001	Laptop

    ProductName depends only on ProductID (not the full key OrderID+ProductID).

Fix (Good):
Orders Table:
| OrderID | ProductID |

Products Table:
| ProductID | ProductName |
3NF (Third Normal Form)

Rule:

    Must be in 2NF + no transitive dependency (non-key columns depend only on the primary key).

Example (Bad):
StudentID	College	CollegeLocation
101	MIT	Boston

    CollegeLocation depends on College (not directly on StudentID).

Fix (Good):
Students Table:
| StudentID | College |

Colleges Table:
| College | CollegeLocation |
BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)

Rule:

    Stricter than 3NF. Every determinant (X → Y) must be a candidate key.

Example (Bad):
Employee	Department	Manager
Alice	HR	John

    Department → Manager, but Department is not a candidate key.

Fix (Good):
Employees Table:
| Employee | Department |

Dept_Managers Table:
| Department | Manager |
Higher Normal Forms (4NF, 5NF, 6NF)

    4NF (Fourth NF):

        Removes multi-valued dependencies.

        Example: A doctor with multiple specialties and languages.

    5NF (Fifth NF):

        Splits join dependencies (rarely used).

    6NF:

        Used in temporal databases (e.g., tracking historical data).

Most databases stop at 3NF or BCNF.
3. Keys in Databases
SuperKey

    Any set of columns that uniquely identifies a row.

    Example:

        For Students(StudentID, Name, Email), superkeys are:

            {StudentID}

            {StudentID, Name}

            {Email} (if unique)

Candidate Key

    A minimal superkey (no extra columns).

    Example:

        {StudentID} and {Email} (if both are unique).

Primary Key

    The chosen candidate key for the table.

    Example:

        StudentID is the primary key.

Summary Table
Concept	Definition	Example
Functional Dependency	X → Y means X determines Y	StudentID → Name
1NF	No repeating groups	Split comma-separated lists
2NF	No partial dependencies	Move ProductName to its table
3NF	No transitive dependencies	Move CollegeLocation
BCNF	Every determinant is a candidate key	Split Department → Manager
SuperKey	Any unique identifier	{StudentID, Name}
Candidate Key	Minimal superkey	{StudentID} or {Email}
Primary Key	Selected candidate key	StudentID
When to Normalize?

    Normalize: For transactional databases (e.g., banking).

    Denormalize: For analytics (e.g., data warehouses).
