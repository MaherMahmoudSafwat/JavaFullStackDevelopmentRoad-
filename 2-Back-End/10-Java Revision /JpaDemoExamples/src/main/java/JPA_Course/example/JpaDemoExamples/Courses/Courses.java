// ==================== UNIDIRECTIONAL VS BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS ====================

/*
üéØ UNIDIRECTIONAL vs BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS EXPLAINED

UNIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP:
- Only ONE entity knows about the other
- Like a one-way street
- You can navigate from A to B, but not from B to A

Example of Unidirectional:
@Entity
public class Student {
    @ManyToMany
    private List<Course> courses; // Student knows about courses
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    // No reference to students - Course doesn't know about students
}

Navigation:
student.getCourses(); // ‚úÖ Works - can get courses from student
course.getStudents(); // ‚ùå Doesn't exist - can't get students from course

BIDIRECTIONAL RELATIONSHIP:
- BOTH entities know about each other
- Like a two-way street
- You can navigate from A to B AND from B to A
- ONE side is the "owning" side (manages the foreign key)
- OTHER side is the "inverse" side (uses mappedBy)

Example of Bidirectional:
@Entity
public class Student {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "students") // Inverse side - doesn't own foreign key
    private List<Course> courses;
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    @ManyToMany // Owning side - manages the foreign key
    @JoinTable(name = "students_courses")
    private List<Student> students;
}

Navigation:
student.getCourses(); // ‚úÖ Works - can get courses from student
course.getStudents(); // ‚úÖ Works - can get students from course

WHICH SIDE OWNS THE RELATIONSHIP?
- The side WITHOUT mappedBy is the owning side
- The side WITH mappedBy is the inverse side
- Only the owning side's annotations affect database structure
- Inverse side is ignored for database schema generation

WHY BIDIRECTIONAL?
- More convenient navigation
- Can query from either direction
- Better object-oriented design
- Reflects real-world relationships
