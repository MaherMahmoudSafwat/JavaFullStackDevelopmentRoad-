# ‚úÖ ALL VOTING ISSUES FIXED!

## üêõ Problems That Were Fixed:

### 1. **"Please log in to vote" Error**
- **Problem**: Code was looking in `localStorage` but app uses `sessionStorage`
- **Fixed**: Now reads user data from `sessionStorage.getItem('currentUser')`

### 2. **Strange Vote Counting (Double Counting Bug)**
- **Problem**: When changing votes, the new answer was incremented TWICE
  - Once in `ChangeUserVote()` method
  - Again in `UpdateAnswerVoteCountPercentage()` method
- **Fixed**: Now only updates percentages after changing votes (no double increment)

### 3. **Answers Changing Position**
- **Problem**: Frontend replaced entire answer array, which could reorder answers
- **Fixed**: Now only updates vote counts and percentages, preserving original order

### 4. **Database Column Name Error**
- **Problem**: SQL query used `Vote_Count` but actual column is `votecount`
- **Fixed**: Updated query to use correct lowercase column names

---

## üìã Files Modified:

### Backend:
1. **SurveyService.java** - Fixed double counting bug
2. **AnswersService.java** - Added `UpdateAnswersPercentageOnly()` method
3. **AnswersRepository.java** - Fixed SQL column names for reset query

### Frontend:
1. **show-all-surveys.ts** - Fixed sessionStorage reading + preserved answer order

## üóëÔ∏è How to Clear All Votes:

### Step 1: Start Backend
```bash
cd "/home/maher/Desktop/JavaFullStackDevelopmentRoad-/2-Back-End/Java Revision /Full Survey Project /FullSurveyProject"
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Clear Votes
Open browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8080/Surveys/ClearAllVotes
```

Or use curl:
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/Surveys/ClearAllVotes
```

You'll see: `"All votes cleared and answer counts reset to 0"`

### Step 3: Delete Temporary Endpoint (IMPORTANT!)
After clearing votes, **remove this code** from `SurveyController.java` (lines 89-95):
```java
// TEMPORARY ENDPOINT - Delete this after clearing votes
@DeleteMapping("/ClearAllVotes")
public String ClearAllVotes()
{
    SurveysService.ClearAllVotesAndResetCounts();
    return "All votes cleared and answer counts reset to 0";
}
```

## ‚úÖ How Voting Works Now (Correctly):

### Case 1: First Time Voting
1. User clicks an answer
2. Backend increments vote count by +1
3. Backend recalculates all percentages
4. Frontend updates display (preserves order)

### Case 2: Changing Vote
1. User clicks different answer
2. Backend decrements old answer by -1
3. Backend increments new answer by +1
4. Backend recalculates all percentages (NO DOUBLE INCREMENT!)
5. Frontend updates display (preserves order)

### Case 3: Same Answer
1. User clicks same answer they already voted for
2. Backend returns unchanged data
3. No changes made

---

## üß™ Testing Steps:

1. **Clear all votes** using the endpoint
2. **Restart backend** (to ensure clean state)
3. **Start frontend**: `ng serve`
4. **Login** to your account
5. **Vote on a survey** - should work correctly
6. **Change your vote** - should decrement old, increment new (no double counting)
7. **Click same answer** - should do nothing
8. **Check answer order** - should never change position

‚úÖ Vote counts are accurate (no double counting)  
‚úÖ Answers stay in original order
