# ====================
# 3. REPOSITORY STATUS
# ====================
# Show the current state of your working directory and staging area

# ====================
# 4. INITIALIZATION
# ====================
# Initialize a new Git repository in current directory
# Creates a hidden .git folder with all version control data
git init

# Initialize a new Git repository with a specific branch name
# Sets the default branch name (instead of the old default 'master')
git init -b main

# ====================
# 5. STAGING FILES
# ====================
# Stage a specific file for the next commit
# Adds Project1.py to the staging area (also called index)
git add Project1.py

# Stage all NEW and MODIFIED files in current directory and subdirectories
# Adds: new files, modified files, deleted files (in current dir only)
git add .

# ====================
# 6. REMOVING FILES
# ====================
# Remove Project1.py from Git tracking (staging area) but keep it in working directory
# The file will remain on your disk but become "untracked"
git rm --cached Project1.py

# ====================
# 7. COMMITTING CHANGES
# ====================
# Create a new commit with all staged changes and a commit message
# Takes everything in the staging area and saves it permanently to repository
git commit -m "That's is my first commit"

# Stage all modified/deleted tracked files and commit with message
# The -a flag automatically stages changes to tracked files (no need for git add)
git commit -a -m "That is my third commit"

# ====================
# 8. VIEWING CHANGES
# ====================
# Show changes between working directory and staging area
# Displays what you've changed but haven't staged yet
git diff

# Show changes that are currently staged (in the staging area/index)
# Displays what will be included in the next commit
git diff --staged

# ====================
# 9. VIEWING HISTORY
# ====================
# Show the commit history of the repository
# Displays all commits in reverse chronological order (newest first)
git log

# Display commit history with one commit per line
# Shows abbreviated commit hash followed by commit message
git log --pretty=oneline

# Display commit history with ASCII graph visualization
# Shows branches, merges, and commit relationships visually
git log --graph

# ====================
# 10. SSH KEYS
# ====================
# Generate a new SSH key pair with the modern OpenSSH format
# The -o flag uses the new OpenSSH format (more secure than older PEM format)
ssh-keygen -o

# ====================
# 11. REMOTE REPOSITORIES
# ====================
# Add a remote repository named "origin" pointing to your GitHub repository
# This connects your local Git repo to a remote server (GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/MaherMahmoudSafwat/Git-Course

# List all remote repositories with their URLs
# Shows both fetch (pull) and push URLs for each remote
git remote -v

# Clone (download) a remote repository to your local machine
# Creates a complete copy of the repository including all history, branches, and tags
git clone https://github.com/MaherMahmoudSafwat/Memory-Match-Game-

# ====================
# 12. PUSHING CHANGES
# ====================
# Push your local commits to the remote repository and set upstream tracking
# First push to connect your local branch to the remote branch
git push -u origin main

# ====================
# 13. TAGS
# ====================
# List all tags in the repository
# Tags are references to specific commits (like bookmarks for important points)
git tag

# Create an annotated tag named V1.0 with a descriptive message
# Annotated tags store extra metadata (author, date, message) - recommended for releases
git tag -a V1.0 -m "This is my first release version"

# Push a specific tag (V1.0) to the remote repository named "origin"
# Tags are NOT pushed automatically with regular git push commands
git push origin V1.0

# Display detailed information about the tag V1.0
# Shows tag metadata and the commit it points to
git show V1.0

# ====================
# 14. BRANCH MANAGEMENT
# ====================
# List all local branches in the repository
# The current branch is marked with an asterisk (*)
git branch

# List ALL branches (local + remote tracking branches)
# Shows every branch that exists in your repository
git branch --all

# Create a new branch named "Feature1" based on current commit
# Does NOT switch to the new branch (you remain on current branch)
git branch Feature1

# Create a new branch named Feature1 AND switch to it immediately
# Combines: git branch Feature1 + git checkout Feature1
git checkout -b Feature1

# Create a new branch named Feature3 AND switch to it immediately
# Modern alternative to: git checkout -b Feature3
git switch -c Feature3

# Rename the CURRENT branch to "Lite-Version"
# You must be on the branch you want to rename
git branch -m Lite-Version

# Delete the Feature3 branch (safe delete)
# Only deletes if Feature3 has been fully merged into current branch
git branch -d Feature3

# ====================
# 15. BRANCH NAVIGATION
# ====================
# Switch to the Feature1 branch (modern alternative to git checkout)
# Changes your working directory to match the Feature1 branch
git switch Feature1

# Switch to the Feature1 branch (classic command)
# Changes your working directory to match Feature1's state
git checkout Feature1

# Switch to the previous branch (last branch you were on)
# The hyphen (-) is a shortcut for "previous branch"
git switch -

# ====================
# 16. MERGING & REBASING
# ====================
# Merge the Feature1 branch INTO the current branch
# Combines changes from Feature1 with current branch
git merge Feature1

# Reapply current branch's commits on top of Feature1 branch
# "Moves" your commits to begin after Feature1's latest commit
git rebase Feature1

# ====================
# 17. PULLING CHANGES
# ====================
# Fetch changes from remote (origin) and merge them into current branch
# Equivalent to: git fetch origin + git merge origin/main
git pull origin main

# ====================
# 18. CHECKOUT SPECIFIC COMMITS
# ====================
# Checkout a specific commit by its hash (enters DETACHED HEAD state)
# Temporarily views the repository as it was at that exact commit
git checkout a66b1789e361dac9f4c34598954d024fb4486acb

# ====================
# 19. STASHING CHANGES
# ====================
# Temporarily save uncommitted changes (modified and staged files)
# Allows you to switch branches without committing incomplete work
git stash

# List all stashed changes with their references
# Shows all saved stashes in LIFO order (newest first)
git stash list

# Apply the most recent stash to current working directory
# Restores stashed changes but keeps the stash in the list
git stash apply
