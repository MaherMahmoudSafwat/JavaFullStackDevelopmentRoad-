 PROJECT: "FOOD DELIVERY MICROSERVICES PLATFORM"
🎯 PROJECT GOAL:

Build a food delivery app like UberEats with microservices, security, and social login!
🏗️ MICROSERVICES ARCHITECTURE:
1. 🚪 API GATEWAY SERVICE
text

ROLE: Main entrance to the system
- Routes requests to correct microservices
- Load balancing between instances
- Security filter chain (JWT validation)
- Rate limiting

2. 👤 USER SERVICE
text

ROLE: Handle user accounts and authentication
- User registration/login
- JWT token generation
- OAuth2 (Google/Facebook login)
- User profiles and preferences
- Password management

3. 🍕 RESTAURANT SERVICE
text

ROLE: Manage restaurants and menus
- Restaurant listings
- Menu management
- Food categories
- Restaurant owner accounts

4. 🛒 ORDER SERVICE
text

ROLE: Handle food orders
- Create new orders
- Order status tracking
- Order history
- Payment processing integration

5. 🚚 DELIVERY SERVICE
text

ROLE: Manage food delivery
- Assign drivers to orders
- Delivery tracking
- Driver management
- Real-time location updates

6. 💬 NOTIFICATION SERVICE
text

ROLE: Send notifications
- Email/SMS notifications
- Push notifications
- Order status updates
- Promotional messages

🔐 SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION:
JWT TOKEN FLOW:
text

1. User logs in → USER SERVICE generates JWT
2. JWT contains: user_id, roles, permissions
3. All requests include JWT in Authorization header
4. API GATEWAY validates JWT before routing
5. Each service trusts the JWT (no re-authentication)

ROLE-BASED ACCESS:
text

👤 CUSTOMER ROLE:
- Browse restaurants
- Place orders
- View order history
- Update profile

👨‍🍳 RESTAURANT OWNER ROLE:
- Manage restaurant menu
- View restaurant orders
- Update order status

🚗 DELIVERY DRIVER ROLE:
- View assigned orders
- Update delivery status
- Mark deliveries complete

👑 ADMIN ROLE:
- Manage all users
- View system analytics
- Manage restaurants

OAUTH2 SOCIAL LOGIN:
text

🔐 LOGIN OPTIONS:
- Email/Password (traditional)
- Google Login
- Facebook Login  
- Apple Login (for iOS users)

🎯 USER EXPERIENCE:
- "Login with Google" button
- Redirect to Google auth
- Return to app with JWT
- Same permissions as email login

📡 COMMUNICATION FLOW EXAMPLES:
Scenario 1: Customer Places Order
text

1. 👤 Customer logs in → gets JWT
2. 🍕 Browses restaurants → RESTAURANT SERVICE
3. 🛒 Places order → ORDER SERVICE + JWT validation
4. 💬 Gets confirmation → NOTIFICATION SERVICE
5. 🚚 Order assigned → DELIVERY SERVICE
6. 📱 Real-time updates to customer

Scenario 2: Restaurant Owner Management
text

1. 👨‍🍳 Restaurant owner logs in → gets JWT
2. 📊 Views dashboard → ORDER SERVICE + RESTAURANT SERVICE
3. ✏️ Updates menu → RESTAURANT SERVICE + JWT validation  
4. 🔔 Gets order notifications → NOTIFICATION SERVICE

Scenario 3: Social Login Flow
text

1. 👤 Clicks "Login with Google"
2. 🔀 Redirect to Google OAuth
3. ✅ Google authenticates user
4. 🔄 Return to app with authorization code
5. 🎫 USER SERVICE exchanges code for user info
6. 🔐 Generate JWT token for the user
7. 🏠 Redirect to dashboard

🗂️ DATA FLOW WITH KAFKA:
Order Processing Events:
text

📦 KAFKA TOPICS:

1. "user-registration" → New user signed up
2. "order-created" → Customer placed order
3. "order-status-updated" → Order status changed
4. "delivery-assigned" → Driver assigned to order
5. "notification-sent" → Notification delivered

🎯 EXAMPLE: Order Placement:
ORDER SERVICE:    produces "order-created" event
RESTAURANT SERVICE: consumes → updates restaurant queue
NOTIFICATION SERVICE: consumes → sends confirmation
DELIVERY SERVICE: consumes → finds available driver
