    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}

@Repository 
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
}

Application Properties:
properties

# Local Database (for development)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/students
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=1234
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop

🎬 358. Creating Database in AWS RDS (8min)
What is RDS?
bash

# RDS = Managed Database Service

  "family": "postgres-task",
  "containerDefinitions": [{
    "name": "postgres",
    "image": "postgres:15",
    "portMappings": [{
      "containerPort": 5432,
      "hostPort": 5432
    }]
  }]
}

🎬 364. Pushing Docker Image to ECR (4min)
What is ECR?
bash

# ECR = Elastic Container Registry
