🚀 Step-by-Step Beanstalk Deployment:
Step 1: Prepare Your Application

1.1 Build Your JAR:
bash

cd /home/maher/Downloads/CloudProjects
mvn clean package -DskipTests=true

✅ Result: target/CloudProjects-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Step 2: Elastic Beanstalk Console Setup

2.1 Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk:
text

AWS Console → Services → Elastic Beanstalk

2.2 Click "Create Application"
Step 3: Configure Environment (Your Screenshot)

3.1 Environment Tier:
text

☑️ Web server environment 
   (for your Spring Boot web app)

3.2 Application Information:
text

Application name: student-management-app

3.3 Environment Information:
text

Environment name: student-app-prod
Domain: student-app-prod.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

3.4 Platform:
text

Platform: Java
Platform branch: Java 25 (Corretto 25)
Platform version: Latest

Step 4: Application Code (CRITICAL PART)

4.1 Source:
text

☑️ Upload your code

4.2 Local File:
text

Click "Upload" → Select your JAR file:
/home/maher/Downloads/CloudProjects/target/CloudProjects-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

4.3 Version Label:
text

Version label: v1-initial-deployment

Step 5: Presets (IMPORTANT CHOICE)

5.1 Configuration Presets:
text

✅ Single instance (free tier eligible)

This gives you: 1 EC2 instance, no load balancer (FREE)
Step 6: Create Environment

6.1 Click "Create environment"
text

⏳ Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment...
✅ SUCCESS: Green checkmark appears
🌐 Your app is LIVE!

Beanstalk Automatically Sets Up:

    ✅ EC2 Instance with correct Java version

    ✅ Security Groups (opens port 80/443)

    ✅ Auto-scaling (if you choose)

    ✅ Health monitoring

    ✅ Logging

    ✅ Environment variables

🔧 Important Configuration Details:
Port Configuration:
yaml

# Beanstalk expects your app on port 5000
# But your Spring Boot uses 8090

# Solution: Add this to application.properties:
server.port=5000

Or Use Beanstalk Environment Variable:
text

In Beanstalk Console → Configuration → Software:
SERVER_PORT = 5000

📝 Complete Deployment Checklist:
Before Deployment:

    mvn clean package successful

    JAR file exists in target folder

    Application runs locally on port 8090

    No database dependencies (for now)

During Deployment:

    Choose "Web server environment"

    Select "Single instance (free tier eligible)"

    Upload correct JAR file

    Use meaningful version label

    Wait for green health status

After Deployment:

    Access: http://student-app-prod.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

    Check logs in Beanstalk console

    Test all endpoints

🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues:
If App Doesn't Start:
bash

# Check Beanstalk logs:
Beanstalk Console → Logs → Request Last 100 Lines

Port Issues:
properties

# In your src/main/resources/application.properties:
server.port=5000

Health Check Failures:
bash

# Ensure your app has a root endpoint:
@GetMapping("/")
public String home() {
    return "App is running!";
}

💰 Cost Considerations:
Free Tier Includes:
text

✅ 750 hours of t2.micro EC2 instance
✅ 30GB of EBS storage  
✅ Load Balancer (if not using single instance)
✅ S3 storage for versions

🎯 Your Immediate Action Plan:
Right Now:
bash

1. Build JAR: mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
2. Go to: AWS Elastic Beanstalk Console
3. Follow the 6 steps above
4. Wait for green status
5. Access your LIVE application!

Expected Timeline:
text

⏱️  Build: 2 minutes
⏱️  Beanstalk setup: 5 minutes  
⏱️  Deployment: 5-10 minutes
⏱️  Total: 15-20 minutes to LIVE app!

🌐 Final Result:

Your app will be available at:
text

http://student-app-prod.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

And you can share this URL with anyone in the world! 🌍
Bottom Line:

Elastic Beanstalk is MUCH easier than manual EC2 deployment. It handles all the infrastructure setup for you, and the "Single instance (free tier eligible)" option is perfect for learning and small projects!
