1. Spring Framework Projects

Spring is a popular Java framework for building applications. Its main projects include:

    Spring Boot (easiest for beginners):
    Quickly create standalone apps with embedded servers (like Tomcat).
    Example: Web apps, REST APIs, microservices.

    Spring MVC: For traditional web apps (uses Servlets behind the scenes).

    Spring Data: Simplifies database access (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

    Spring Security: Handles login/auth for apps.

Alternatives to Spring Boot?
Yes! You can use:

    Servlets + JSP (old-school, more manual work).

    Micronaut/Quarkus (like Spring Boot but lighter).

    Play Framework (for Scala/Java web apps).

2. What are Servlets?

    Servlets are Java classes that handle web requests (e.g., HTTP GET/POST).

    They run inside a Servlet Container (like Tomcat).

    Example:
    java

    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
            response.getWriter().print("Hello World!");
        }
    }

3. Tomcat vs JVM
Tomcat	JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
A Servlet Container that runs Java web apps.	The engine that executes all Java programs (including Tomcat!).
Handles HTTP requests/responses.	Runs bytecode (.class files) on any OS.
Needs the JVM to work.	Doesn’t need Tomcat (but Tomcat needs it).
4. Can You Use Servlets in JVM?

    No, Servlets need a Servlet Container (like Tomcat, Jetty).

    The JVM alone can’t run Servlets—it’s like trying to drive a car without wheels!

    Tomcat (which runs on the JVM) manages Servlets for you.

Simple Analogy

    JVM = Car engine.

    Tomcat = The whole car (with seats, wheels, etc.).

    Servlets = Drivers (need the car to work).

    Spring Boot = A fancy self-driving car (uses Tomcat/Servlets internally).

What Should You Learn First?

    Servlets + JSP → Understand basics of web apps.

    Spring Boot → Build modern apps faster.

Try this in order:

Servlets → Spring Boot → Databases (Spring Data) → Security (Spring Security)
