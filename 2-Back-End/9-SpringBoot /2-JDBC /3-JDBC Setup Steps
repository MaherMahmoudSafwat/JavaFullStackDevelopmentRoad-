Theoretical Steps to Set Up JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

To establish a JDBC connection between a Java application and a database, follow these high-level theoretical steps:
1. Understand JDBC Architecture

JDBC acts as a bridge between Java applications and databases, allowing Java programs to execute SQL queries and retrieve results.
2. Key Components Involved

    JDBC Driver: A database-specific implementation that enables communication.

    Connection URL: A string that specifies the database location, credentials, and other parameters.

    Connection Object: Represents a session with the database.

    Statement/PreparedStatement: Used to execute SQL queries.

    ResultSet: Holds the data returned from a query.

3. Steps to Configure JDBC

    Choose the Appropriate JDBC Driver

        Type 4 (Thin Driver) is commonly used (pure Java, communicates directly with the DB).

        Database vendors provide their own JDBC drivers (e.g., MySQL Connector/J, PostgreSQL JDBC, Oracle JDBC).

    Add JDBC Driver to the Project

        Either download the JAR file and include it in the classpath.

        Or use a dependency management tool like Maven/Gradle to import it.

    Load the JDBC Driver (Optional in modern JDBC, as auto-loading is supported)

        Historically done via Class.forName("driver.class.Name").

    Establish a Connection

        Use DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password) with a properly formatted connection URL.

    Execute SQL Queries

        Create a Statement or PreparedStatement for executing queries.

        Use executeQuery() for SELECT and executeUpdate() for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.

    Process Results

        Iterate over the ResultSet to retrieve data.

    Close Resources

        Ensure Connection, Statement, and ResultSet are closed to prevent leaks (use try-with-resources for automatic handling).

4. Error Handling & Best Practices

    Use try-catch blocks to handle SQLException.

    Prefer PreparedStatement over Statement to avoid SQL injection.

    Use connection pooling (e.g., HikariCP) for better performance in production.

5. Testing the Connection

    A simple "SELECT 1" query can verify if the connection works.
