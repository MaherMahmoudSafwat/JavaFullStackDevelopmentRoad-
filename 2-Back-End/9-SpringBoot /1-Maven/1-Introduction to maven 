What is Maven?

Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java-based projects. It simplifies the build process by handling:

    Dependency management (automatically downloading libraries)

    Compilation

    Testing

    Packaging (JAR, WAR, etc.)

    Deployment

Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file (pom.xml) to define project structure, dependencies, and build steps.
Why Was Maven Created?

Before Maven, developers used Apache Ant, which required writing lengthy and complex XML scripts for builds. Ant lacked:

    Standardized project structure

    Built-in dependency management

    Convention over configuration

Maven was introduced in 2004 to solve these problems by introducing:
✅ Standardized project layout (src/main/java, src/test/java, etc.)
✅ Automatic dependency resolution (from Maven Central Repository)
✅ Lifecycle-based builds (compile → test → package → install)
✅ Plugins for common tasks (compiling, testing, generating docs)
Key Features & Uses of Maven
Feature	Why It’s Useful
Dependency Management	No manual JAR downloads; Maven fetches them automatically.
Build Lifecycle	Standardized phases (clean, compile, test, package, install).
POM (Project Object Model)	Single pom.xml file defines everything—no need for custom scripts.
Maven Central Repository	Huge library of open-source Java packages (like log4j, JUnit).
Plugin Ecosystem	Extensible with plugins for code coverage, Docker, etc.
How Maven Works (Example Workflow)

    Define pom.xml (lists dependencies & build steps).

    Run mvn compile → Maven downloads dependencies & compiles code.

    Run mvn test → Runs unit tests.

    Run mvn package → Creates a JAR/WAR file.

    Run mvn install → Installs the built artifact in your local repository.

Example pom.xml:
xml

<project>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.mycompany</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.12</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>

Maven vs. Alternatives
Tool	Pros	Cons
Maven	Standardized, great for dependency management.	Can be slow; XML-based config.
Gradle	Faster, flexible (Groovy/Kotlin DSL).	Steeper learning curve.
Ant	Highly customizable.	No built-in dependency management.
Conclusion: Why Use Maven?

✔ Saves time (no manual dependency management).
✔ Standardizes projects (easier collaboration).
✔ Huge ecosystem (plugins for almost everything).

It’s still widely used, though Gradle is gaining popularity (especially in Android/Kotlin projects).
