Here's a clear explanation of the differences between dependencies and plugins in software development (particularly Java/Maven), along with the meaning of POM:
1. Dependencies vs. Plugins
Aspect	Dependencies	Plugins
Purpose	Libraries your project needs to run (e.g., Spring, JUnit).	Tools that perform tasks during the build process (e.g., compiling code, packaging JARs).
When Used	Required at compile-time and runtime.	Executed during specific build phases (e.g., compile, test, package).
Example	log4j (for logging), hibernate (for ORM).	maven-compiler-plugin (compiles Java code), maven-surefire-plugin (runs tests).
Scope	Used by your application code.	Used by Maven itself to manage the build lifecycle.
2. What is POM?

    POM stands for Project Object Model.

    Itâ€™s the core file in Maven (pom.xml) that defines:

        Project metadata (e.g., groupId, artifactId, version).

        Dependencies (libraries your project uses).

        Plugins (tools for building/testing/packaging).

        Build lifecycle (how your project is compiled, tested, and deployed).

Key Sections in a POM:
xml

<project>
  <!-- Metadata -->
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>

  <!-- Dependencies -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId>
      <version>5.3.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <!-- Plugins -->
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.8.1</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>

3. Key Differences Summarized

    Dependencies = "What my project needs to work."
    (e.g., External JARs like Spring, Apache Commons).

    Plugins = "How Maven should build my project."
    (e.g., Compiler plugins, test runners, JAR packagers).

    POM = "The blueprint that ties it all together."

4. Practical Example

Imagine building a car:

    Dependencies = Parts (engine, wheels).

    Plugins = Tools (wrench, paint sprayer).

    POM = The instruction manual.
