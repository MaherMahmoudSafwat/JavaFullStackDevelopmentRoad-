-- Turn off automatic committing of each individual statement
-- Now we must explicitly COMMIT or ROLLBACK our transactions
SET AUTOCOMMIT = 0;  -- Same as SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF

-- Start a new transaction (optional when AUTOCOMMIT=0, but good practice)
BEGIN;

-- Example: Transfer $100 from account 1 to account 2
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Verify the results before finalizing
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id IN (1, 2);

-- If everything looks correct, make the changes permanent
COMMIT;  -- Saves all changes in this transaction to the database

-- Alternatively, if there was an error:
-- ROLLBACK;  -- Would undo all changes in this transaction
