/*
 * FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT EXAMPLES
 * All variations for the Orders->Customer relationship
 * Note: CustomerID column must allow NULL for SET NULL operations
 */

-- 1. STRONG RELATIONSHIP: Child records deleted when parent is deleted
-- Use when orders shouldn't exist without a customer
ALTER TABLE Orders 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CASCADE 
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID) 
ON DELETE CASCADE;  -- Deletes orders when customer is deleted
-- ON UPDATE defaults to RESTRICT (prevents customer ID changes)

-- 2. SEMI-FLEXIBLE RELATIONSHIP: Preserves orders but maintains ID sync
-- Use when orders should persist but keep updated customer IDs
ALTER TABLE Orders 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_SETNULL_CASCADE 
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID) 
ON DELETE SET NULL   -- Keeps orders but nullifies customer reference
ON UPDATE CASCADE;   -- Updates order's CustomerID if customer's ID changes

-- 3. FLEXIBLE RELATIONSHIP: Decouples on both delete and update
-- Use when orders should persist independently of customer changes
ALTER TABLE Orders 
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_SETNULL_BOTH 
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID) 
ON DELETE SET NULL   -- Keeps orders but nullifies on customer deletion
ON UPDATE SET NULL;  -- Nullifies reference if customer ID changes

/*
 * EXECUTION NOTES:
 * 1. Run these separately (only one can be active at a time)
 * 2. Drop previous constraint first if modifying:
 *    ALTER TABLE Orders DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_CASCADE;
 * 3. Verify column allows NULL before SET NULL operations:
 *    ALTER TABLE Orders MODIFY CustomerID INT NULL;
