-- Define a Common Table Expression (CTE) named 'CTE_Example'
-- CTEs act as temporary result sets that exist only during query execution
WITH CTE_Example AS

    -- This is the CTE's query definition:
    -- Selects the maximum value from the 'Number' column
    SELECT MAX(Number) AS MaxNumber
    -- From the 'Products' table
    FROM Products
    -- Where the Product_id is greater than 1 (filters out products with ID 1 or less)
    WHERE Product_id > 1
)
-- Main query that uses the CTE
-- Selects all columns (just one in this case) from the CTE result set
