-- 1. UNION (combines and removes duplicates)
SELECT account_balance FROM large_dataset  -- Selects balance column from first table
UNION                                      -- Combines results and removes duplicate rows
SELECT ID FROM Employees;                  -- Selects ID column from second table

-- 2. UNION ALL (combines and keeps duplicates)
SELECT id FROM large_dataset  -- Selects id column from first table
UNION ALL                    -- Combines results without removing duplicates
SELECT ID FROM Employees;    -- Selects ID column from second table

-- 3. INTERSECT (returns only common values - emulated in MySQL)

SELECT id FROM large_dataset INTERSECT SELECT ID FROM Employees;

SELECT id FROM large_dataset  -- Selects from first table
WHERE id IN (                -- Filters for values that exist in both tables
    SELECT ID FROM Employees -- Subquery checks second table
);

-- 4. EXCEPT (returns only values in first table - emulated in MySQL)
SELECT id FROM large_dataset  -- Selects from first table
WHERE id NOT IN (            -- Filters for values not present in second table
    SELECT ID FROM Employees -- Subquery checks second table
);
