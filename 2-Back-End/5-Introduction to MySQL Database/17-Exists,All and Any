-- Query 1: Returns ALL customer countries IF customer ID 7 exists
-- EXISTS returns TRUE if the subquery returns any rows
-- Note: This returns ALL countries if ID 7 exists, none otherwise (probably not what you want)
SELECT CustomerCountry 
FROM Customer 
WHERE EXISTS (
    -- Subquery checks for existence of customer with ID 7
    -- SELECT 1 is used because we only care about existence, not values
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Customer 
    WHERE CustomerID = 7
);

-- Query 2: Returns ALL customer countries IF customer ID 7 DOES NOT exist
-- NOT EXISTS returns TRUE only when the subquery returns no rows
SELECT CustomerCountry 
FROM Customer 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM Customer 
    WHERE CustomerID = 7
);

-- Query 3: Returns ALL order IDs where the ID equals EVERY order ID > 109
-- = ALL only makes sense when the subquery returns 0 or 1 rows
-- If subquery is empty (no orders > 109), returns ALL orders (because the condition is vacuously true)
-- If subquery has multiple rows, would return nothing (impossible to equal multiple values)
SELECT OrderID  
FROM Orders  
WHERE OrderID = ALL (     
    SELECT OrderID      
    FROM Orders      
    WHERE OrderID > 109 
);

-- Query 4: THIS QUERY HAS A TYPO ("ANYU" should be "ANY")
-- Corrected version would return orders where ID matches ANY order ID > 109
-- Equivalent to: WHERE OrderID IN (SELECT OrderID FROM Orders WHERE OrderID > 109)
SELECT OrderID  
FROM Orders  
WHERE OrderID = ANY (     
    SELECT OrderID      
    FROM Orders      
    WHERE OrderID > 109 
);
