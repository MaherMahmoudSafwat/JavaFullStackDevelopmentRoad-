-- VIEW CREATION: 'Viewer'
-- =============================================

/*
WHAT THIS DOES:
Creates a virtual table (view) named 'Viewer' that contains data from the 'Orders' table
based on the specified selection criteria.

KEY POINTS:
1. A view doesn't store data physically - it's a saved query that runs whenever accessed
2. The view will always show CURRENT data from the underlying 'Orders' table
3. Views are useful for:
   - Simplifying complex queries
   - Restricting access to certain columns
   - Providing consistent business logic
*/
CREATE VIEW Viewer AS 
-- SELECT statement defines what data the view will show
SELECT ORDERNAME  -- Only includes the ORDERNAME column from the source table
FROM Orders       -- Specifies the source table
WHERE ORDERID >= 103;  -- Filter: only includes rows where ORDERID is 103 or higher

-- =============================================
-- VIEW DELETION: 'Viewer'
-- =============================================

/*
WHAT THIS DOES:
Permanently removes the 'Viewer' view from the database.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. This only removes the view definition, NOT the underlying data in the 'Orders' table
2. Any permissions specific to this view will also be dropped
3. After dropping, you'll need to recreate the view to use it again
4. No warning is given if the view doesn't exist (use IF EXISTS to prevent errors)
*/
DROP VIEW Viewer;  -- Basic drop command

-- SAFER ALTERNATIVE (checks if view exists first):
-- DROP VIEW IF EXISTS Viewer;
