Comparison of Full Data Scan vs. Database Indexing in SQL (General and MySQL-Specific)
General SQL Concepts
Full Data Scan (Table Scan)

    Definition: A full scan of the entire table to find matching rows

    When it occurs:

        No appropriate index exists for the query

        Query needs to process most rows in the table

        Index statistics indicate a full scan would be faster

    Characteristics:

        Reads every row in the table

        Sequential I/O operations

        No additional storage overhead

        Performance degrades linearly with table size

Database Indexing

    Definition: A data structure that improves data retrieval speed

    Types:

        B-tree (most common for standard queries)

        Hash (good for equality comparisons)

        Bitmap (for low-cardinality columns)

        Full-text (for text searching)

    Characteristics:

        Faster data retrieval for specific queries

        Additional storage space required

        Slower for write operations (insert/update/delete)

        Random I/O operations (but fewer of them)

MySQL-Specific Details
Full Table Scans in MySQL

    Detection: Look for "type = ALL" in EXPLAIN output

    Optimizations:

        MySQL may use a "read-ahead" strategy for sequential scans

        InnoDB buffer pool helps cache frequently accessed data

    When MySQL chooses full scans:

        Small tables (where index lookup overhead isn't justified)

        Queries with LIMIT that match early rows

        Queries that would use > ~20-30% of rows via index

Indexing in MySQL

    Storage Engine Differences:

        InnoDB: Clustered index (primary key is the table), secondary indexes point to PK

        MyISAM: Non-clustered, indexes point directly to data rows

    Index Types:

        Primary Key: Always indexed, clustered in InnoDB

        Secondary Indexes: Additional indexes on other columns

        Composite Indexes: Multiple columns in one index

        Covering Index: Index contains all columns needed for query

    MySQL-Specific Behaviors:

        Index merge optimization (uses multiple indexes then combines)

        Index condition pushdown (filters rows in storage engine)

        Index extensions (InnoDB appends PK to secondary indexes)

Performance Comparison
Factor	Full Scan	Indexed Access
Small table	Faster	Slower
Large table	Slower	Faster
High selectivity query	Slow	Fast
Low selectivity query	Fast	Slow
Insert performance	N/A	Slower
Storage overhead	None	Additional
Maintenance	None	Required
Best Practices in MySQL

    Index when:

        Columns are frequently in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY

        Tables are large and queries selective

        You can create covering indexes for common queries

    Avoid indexes when:

        Tables are small

        Columns have low cardinality (few distinct values)

        Write performance is critical and reads are infrequent

    MySQL-specific tips:

        Use EXPLAIN to analyze query plans

        Consider index selectivity (cardinality/number_of_rows)

        Composite indexes should follow leftmost prefix rule

        Monitor index usage with INFORMATION_SCHEMA.STATISTICS

Example in MySQL
sql

-- Table without index (full scan)
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
-- Likely shows "type: ALL"

-- Add index
CREATE INDEX idx_last_name ON customers(last_name);

-- Now using index
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
-- Likely shows "type: ref", "key: idx_last_name"

-- Covering index example
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON customers(last_name, first_name, email);
EXPLAIN SELECT last_name, first_name, email FROM customers WHERE last_name = 'Smith';
-- Shows "Using index" in Extra column

In MySQL, the choice between full scans and indexed access depends on table size, query patterns, and the specific storage engine being used. The query optimizer makes this decision based on statistics about the data distribution.

ALTER TABLE large_dataset DROP Age_Index; -- To Drop the Index.
