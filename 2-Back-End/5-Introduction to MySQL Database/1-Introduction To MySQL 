MySQL: A Comprehensive Overview
What is MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing relational databases. It's one of the most popular database systems in the world, known for its:

    Speed and reliability

    Ease of use

    Cross-platform support (Linux, Windows, macOS)

    Strong community and enterprise support (owned by Oracle)

Storage Engines in MySQL

MySQL uses a pluggable storage engine architecture, which means you can choose different storage engines for different tables based on your needs.
Major Storage Engine Types:

    InnoDB (Default since MySQL 5.5)

        Supports transactions (ACID compliant)

        Row-level locking

        Foreign key constraints

        Crash recovery

        Best for most applications needing reliability

    MyISAM (Legacy)

        Table-level locking

        Faster for read-heavy workloads

        No transactions or foreign keys

        Used in older MySQL versions

    MEMORY (HEAP)

        Stores data in memory

        Extremely fast but volatile (data lost on restart)

        Good for temporary tables/caches

    ARCHIVE

        Optimized for storing large amounts of unindexed data

        Good for logging or historical data

    CSV

        Stores data in CSV format

        Useful for data exchange

    BLACKHOLE

        Accepts but doesn't store data

        Useful for replication setups

    FEDERATED

        Allows access to tables on remote MySQL servers

        Doesn't store data locally

Working with MySQL on Linux Command Line
Installation (Ubuntu/Debian)
bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Basic Commands

    Login to MySQL:

bash

mysql -u username -p

    Show Databases:

sql

SHOW DATABASES;

    Create Database:

sql

CREATE DATABASE dbname;

    Use Database:

sql

USE dbname;

    Show Tables:

sql

SHOW TABLES;

    Create Table (with engine specification):

sql

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
) ENGINE=InnoDB;

    Check Storage Engine of Table:

sql

SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'tablename';

    Change Storage Engine:

sql

ALTER TABLE tablename ENGINE=InnoDB;

    Basic CRUD Operations:

sql

-- Insert
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John', 'john@example.com');

-- Select
SELECT * FROM users;

-- Update
UPDATE users SET email='new@example.com' WHERE id=1;

-- Delete
DELETE FROM users WHERE id=1;

    Exit MySQL:

sql

EXIT;

Administration Commands

    Start MySQL Service:

bash

sudo systemctl start mysql

    Stop MySQL Service:

bash

sudo systemctl stop mysql

    Check MySQL Status:

bash

sudo systemctl status mysql

    Backup Database:

bash

mysqldump -u username -p dbname > backup.sql

    Restore Database:

bash

mysql -u username -p dbname < backup.sql

Performance Tips

    Choose the right storage engine for your use case

    Use indexes appropriately

    Normalize your database design

    Optimize queries with EXPLAIN

    Configure appropriate buffer sizes in my.cnf

Security Best Practices

    Always run mysql_secure_installation after installation

    Don't use the root account for applications

    Grant minimal necessary privileges to users

    Keep MySQL updated

    Use strong passwords

MySQL is a powerful tool that can handle everything from small personal projects to large enterprise applications. The command-line interface gives you full control over your databases, though many users eventually prefer GUI tools like MySQL Workbench for complex operations.
