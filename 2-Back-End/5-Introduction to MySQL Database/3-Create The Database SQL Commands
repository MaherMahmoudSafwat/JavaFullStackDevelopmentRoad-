What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically in a computer system. Databases allow for efficient storage, retrieval, updating, and management of information.
Key Characteristics of Databases:

    Structured storage: Data is organized in tables, documents, or other formats

    Centralized management: Data can be accessed and managed through a database management system (DBMS)

    Multi-user access: Allows concurrent access by multiple users/applications

    Data integrity: Maintains accuracy and consistency of data

    Security: Provides controlled access to authorized users

    Query capabilities: Allows searching and filtering of data

Common Types of Databases:

    Relational Databases (SQL): Organize data in tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

    NoSQL Databases: Flexible schemas for unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra)

    Graph Databases: Store data in nodes and relationships (e.g., Neo4j)

    Time-Series Databases: Optimized for time-stamped data (e.g., InfluxDB)

    In-Memory Databases: Store data in RAM for fast access (e.g., Redis)

Database Management Systems (DBMS)

Software that interacts with databases, applications, and users to capture and analyze data (e.g., MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database)

Databases are fundamental to most modern applications, from simple mobile apps to complex enterprise systems. 


SQL Commands to create a Database;
----------------------------------

-- 1. Creates a new database named 'Products'
-- Will throw an error if 'Products' already exists
CREATE DATABASE Products;

-- 2. Creates a database named 'Company' only if it doesn't exist
-- Prevents errors if database already exists
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Company;

-- 3. Sets 'Products' as the active database for subsequent operations
-- All following commands will affect this database
USE Products;

-- 4. Lists all tables in the currently selected database
-- Returns empty result if no tables exist
SHOW TABLES;

-- 5. Modifies the 'Products' database to use UTF-8 character encoding
-- utf8_general_ci provides case-insensitive sorting
ALTER DATABASE Products CHARACTER SET = utf8 COLLATE = utf8_general_ci;

-- 6. Permanently deletes the 'Products' database and ALL its contents
-- WARNING: This action cannot be undone!
DROP DATABASE Products;
