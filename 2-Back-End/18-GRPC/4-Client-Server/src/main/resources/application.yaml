# GRPC CLIENT CONFIGURATION
# =========================
# Defines gRPC client stubs that connect to remote gRPC servers
# Each stub configuration corresponds to a @GrpcClient annotation in code

grpc:
  client:
    # STOCK MARKET SERVICE CONNECTION
    # Configuration name: 'StockMarketStub'
    # Used with: @GrpcClient("StockMarketStub")
    StockMarketStub:
      # Server address and port
      # Format: "static://hostname:port"
      # 'static://' means fixed address (no service discovery)
      address: "static://localhost:9090"

      # Connection security type
      # PLAINTEXT = No encryption (development only)
      # TLS = Encrypted connection (production)
      # NEVER use PLAINTEXT in production!
      negotiationType: PLAINTEXT

      # Optional TLS configuration for production:
      # negotiationType: TLS
      # trustCertCollection: file:///path/to/certificate.pem
