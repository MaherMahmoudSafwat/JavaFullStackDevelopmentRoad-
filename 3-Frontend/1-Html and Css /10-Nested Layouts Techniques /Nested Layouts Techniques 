Nested Layouts Technique
There are 2 types of layouts:
1. Vertical Layout 2. Horizontal Layout
Most designs can be created using:
● Vertical layout inside horizontal layout inside vertical layout ...
OR
● Horizontal layout inside vertical layout inside horizontal layout ...
To Create the Vertical Layouts
● Use <div>s with display: block (most common)
● Use flexbox (explained later) with flex-direction: column
● Use CSS grid (explained later) with 1 column
To Create the Horizontal Layouts
● Use <div>s with display: inline-block (not recommended)
● Use flexbox with flex-direction: row
● Use CSS grid with multiple columns
Inline CSS Styles
Another way of writing css, using the style="..." attribute:
<div style="
background-color: red;
color: white;
">
...
</div>
● Inline style = CSS is written within a line of HTML.
● Inline styles only affect the element with the
style="..." attribute (no selectors are needed).
