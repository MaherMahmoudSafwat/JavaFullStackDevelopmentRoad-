Position Absolute
.absolute {
position: absolute;
Positions the element on the page (it will scroll with the page and
will not stick when scrolling).
top: 0; Places the element 0px from the top of the page.
bottom: 10px; 10px from the bottom of the page.
left: 50px; 50px from the left of the page.
right: 100px; 100px from the right of the page.
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
}
Sets the element's width to 100px.
Sets the element's height to 100px.
Position Absolute Inside Position Fixed
● When a position: absolute element is inside a position: fixed element, it will be
positioned relative to the fixed element.
● This rule also applies to any position value that is not position: static.
● This lets us place elements in the corners of other elements. For example, a "Close"
button in the top-right corner.
<div style="
position: fixed;
width: 100px;
">
<button style="
position: absolute;
top: 0;
right: 0;
">
X
</button>
</div>
The position: absolute element will be placed in the
top-right of the position: fixed element.
Position Relative
.relative {
position: relative;
The element will appear normally (as if it's position: static).
We can then push it around with top/bottom/left/right.
top: 10px; Places the element 10px from the top of its original position
(pushes it down by 10px). Unlike margin, it won't push the rest of
the page down.
bottom: 10px; Places the element 10px from the bottom of its original position
(pushes it up by 10px).
left: 50px; Places the element 50px from the left of its original position.
right: 100px; Places the element 100px from the right of its original position.
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
}
Sets the element's width to 100px.
Sets the element's height to 100px.
Position Absolute Inside Position Relative
● When a position: absolute element is inside a position: relative element, it will
be positioned relative to the relative element.
● Useful if we want to display an element normally (using position: relative), but still
be able to place other elements in the corner (using position: absolute).
<div style="
position: relative;
width: 100px;
">
<button style="
position: absolute;
top: 0;
right: 0;
">
3
</button>
</div>
The position: absolute element will be placed in
the top-right of the position: relative element.
z-index
Determines which elements appear in front and behind:
● Elements with a higher z-index appear in front of elements with a lower z-index. The
default z-index is 0.
● Elements with position: static; always appear at the back. z-index has no effect.
● If the z-index is equal or both elements are position: static, the element that was
written later in the code will appear in front.
.fixed {
position: fixed;
z-index: 2;
}
.absolute {
position: absolute;
z-index: 1;
}
.static {
position: static;
}
This element will appear in front of the position: absolute;
element because it has a higher z-index.
This element will appear at the back since it's position: static.
