CSS Properties
Here are some common CSS properties we can use:
button {
background-color: red; Sets the background color. Common values:
● Color name: red, white, black
● rgb value: rgb(0, 150, 255);
● Hex value: #0096FF
color: white; Sets the text color. Takes the same values as
background-color (color name, rgb, hex).
height: 36px; Sets the height. Common values:
● Pixel value: 36px
● Percentage: 50%
width: 105px; Sets the width. Takes the same values as height.
border: none; Removes the border.
border-radius: 2px; Creates rounded corners.
cursor: pointer; Changes the mouse/cursor when hovering over the element.
border-color: red; Sets the border color.
border-style: solid; Sets the border style. Common values:
● solid
● dotted
● dashed
border-width: 1px; Sets the border width.
}
How To Google CSS Properties
We regularly use Google to search for CSS properties that we don't know or don't remember.
When using Google, search what you're trying to accomplish. Exampes:
"css rounded corners"
"css text italic"
"css adjust space between lines"
CSS Values
Each CSS property has a set of values that are allowed (background-color allows color values,
cursor allows solid, dotted, dashed, etc.)
Here are some categories of values that are useful to know:
Color Values
1. A color name: red, white, black
2. RGB value: rgb(0, 150, 255);
RGB is a more precise way of measuring color. Every color can be created using a
combination of red, green, and blue (RGB). In CSS, this is represented by rgb(...);
Each color has a min value = 0 and a max value = 255.
rgb(0, 0, 0); = black
rgb(255, 255, 255); = white
3. Hex value
Hex is another way to write RGB.
● Each character in Hex is base 16, which means it can have a value of 0, 1, 2, ... 8, 9, A, B, C,
D, E, F (16 possible values).
● Using the first 2 characters, we can have 16 * 16 = 256 possible values from 0 - 255:
00 = 0
01 = 1
...
0F = 15
10 = 16
11 = (1 * 16) + 1 = 17
...
FF = (15 * 16) + 15 = 255
● This is the same range as RGB (0 to 255), so the first 2 characters in Hex are used to
represent red, the second 2 characters represent green, and the third 2 characters
represent blue. Usually, it's easier to use a Hex to RGB calculator to convert.
4. RGBA value: rgba(0, 150, 255, 0.5);
Same as RGB, except with an additional a-value (alpha value). The a-value determines
how see-through the color is. 0 = complete see-through, 1 = solid color and not
see-through, 0.5 = 50% see-through.
Measurement Values
1. Pixels: 50px, 100px
Pixels (px) are a common unit of measurement in the digital world.
For example: a 4K screen is 3840px by 2160px.
2. Percent: 50%, 100%
A relative measurement. For example, width: 50%; means 50% of the width of the page
(or if the element is inside another element, 50% of the width of the container element).
3. em / rem: 1em, 1rem
Relative measurements that are useful for accessibility.
em = relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the font size).
rem = relative to the font-size of the page, which is 16px by default (2rem means 2 times
the font size of the page = 2 * 16px = 32px by default).
Class Attribute
Class attribute = lets us target specific elements with CSS.
<button class="subscribe-button">
SUBSCRIBE
</button>
Add a class to an element. The class name (the
text between the "...") can be anything you
want, but no spaces.
.subscribe-button {
...
}
Target all elements on the page with
class="subscribe-button"
<button class="youtube-button">
SUBSCRIBE
</button>
<button class="youtube-button">
JOIN
</button>
Multiple elements can have the same class
<button class="youtube-button subscribe-button">
SUBSCRIBE
</button>
An element can have multiple
classes, separated by space
button {
...
}
.youtube-button {
...
}
.subscribe-button {
...
}
