What is Node.js?
Node.js is like having a JavaScript engine that can run outside of web browsers.
Simple Explanation
Normally, JavaScript can only run inside web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox). But Node.js lets JavaScript run on your computer directly, just like other programming languages (Python, Java, etc.).
Think of it this way:

Without Node.js: JavaScript is like a fish that can only live in water (web browsers)
With Node.js: JavaScript becomes like a dolphin that can jump out of water and do things on land (your computer)

What Node.js Actually Does

Runs JavaScript on your computer (not just in browsers)
Provides tools for building applications
Includes NPM (Node Package Manager) - like an app store for JavaScript tools
Handles file operations - reading, writing, creating files
Manages server operations - can create web servers


Why Do We Need Node.js for Angular?
Even though Angular runs in web browsers, we need Node.js during development for several important reasons:
1. NPM (Package Manager)

What it is: Like Google Play Store or App Store, but for JavaScript tools
Why we need it: Angular itself is downloaded and installed through NPM
What it does: Downloads Angular and thousands of helpful tools automatically

2. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)

What it is: A magical command-line tool that creates Angular projects
Why we need it: Makes creating Angular apps super easy (one command creates entire project structure)
Runs on: Node.js

3. Development Server

What it is: A local web server that runs on your computer
Why we need it: Lets you see your Angular app in browser while developing
How it works: Node.js creates a mini web server on your computer

4. Build Tools

What they do: Convert your Angular code into optimized files for browsers
Why needed: Angular uses TypeScript and modern JavaScript features that need conversion
Powered by: Node.js

Simple analogy: Node.js is like having a construction site manager who organizes all the tools, workers, and processes needed to build your house (Angular app), even though the final house will be lived in by browsers.

Complete Step-by-Step Installation Guide for Linux Mint
Let's install everything needed to develop Angular applications in IntelliJ IDEA:
Step 1: Install Node.js and NPM
Method 1: Using Node Version Manager (NVM) - RECOMMENDED
This lets you install and manage multiple Node.js versions easily.

Understanding the Errors and Questions
Let me explain everything in simple terms and fix your issues:
What is Angular CLI vs ng?
They are THE SAME THING!

Angular CLI = The full name (Angular Command Line Interface)
ng = The short command you type

Think of it like this:

Angular CLI is like saying "Microsoft Word" (full name)
ng is like clicking the Word icon on your desktop (shortcut)

When you install Angular CLI with npm install -g @angular/cli, you get the ng command that you can use in terminal.
Can You Use Angular with GUI Instead of Command Lines?
YES and NO - let me explain:
What You CAN Do with GUI:

Write code in IntelliJ IDEA (visual editor)
Design layouts visually
Debug with visual tools
Manage files with file explorer

What You STILL Need Command Line For:

Creating new projects (ng new project-name)
Running development server (ng serve)
Building for production (ng build)
Installing packages (npm install)

Think of it like cooking:

GUI = Your kitchen (visual workspace)
Command line = Your oven and stove (essential tools)

You can prepare ingredients visually, but you still need the oven to cook!

Fixing Your Errors
You have two main problems:
Problem 1: Version Compatibility Issue ⚠️
Your Node.js version (v21.7.3) is not officially supported by Angular CLI. Angular CLI wants:

Node.js version: ^20.19.0 OR ^22.12.0 OR >=24.0.0
Your version: v21.7.3 (this version is not in the supported list)

Problem 2: Permission Error 🔒
You don't have permission to install in system directories.
SOLUTION: Complete Fix
