Complete Roadmap to Becoming a Full-Stack Java Web Developer in 2025 🚀
This roadmap will guide you from absolute beginner to full-stack Java web developer step by step.

📌 1. Learn the Fundamentals of Programming
Before jumping into Java web development, you must understand basic programming concepts:

🔹 Learn Core Programming Concepts (Regardless of Language)
Variables & Data Types (int, float, String, boolean, etc.)
Control Structures (if-else, switch, loops)
Functions & Methods
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation)
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs)
✅ Recommended Resources:

Harvard’s CS50 Course (Free on YouTube)
Book: “Head First Java” by Kathy Sierra
Course: Java Programming on Udemy / Coursera
📌 2. Master Core Java (Beginner to Advanced)
Java is the foundation of full-stack Java development, so you must be comfortable with:

🔹 Essential Java Topics:
Java Syntax & Data Types
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Exception Handling (try-catch-finally)
Multithreading & Concurrency
Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue)
Lambda Expressions & Streams API
File Handling (Read/Write Files)
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
✅ Recommended Resources:

Java SE 17+ Documentation (latest LTS version)
Java Programming on GeeksforGeeks & JavaTPoint
📌 3. Learn Version Control (Git & GitHub)
Every developer must use Git for code management.

🔹 Essential Git Commands:
git init – Initialize a repository
git add . – Add files
git commit -m "message" – Commit changes
git push origin main – Push code to GitHub
git pull origin main – Pull latest code
✅ Recommended Resources:

Course: GitHub for Beginners (Udemy)
📌 4. Learn Databases (SQL & NoSQL)
Full-stack developers must know both relational and NoSQL databases.

🔹 Learn SQL (Relational Databases – MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
Joins, Subqueries, Indexing
Transactions, Stored Procedures
🔹 Learn NoSQL (MongoDB, Firebase)
JSON-based data storage
Documents & Collections
Aggregation Framework
✅ Recommended Resources:

SQL Course: SQL for Beginners (Udemy, Coursera)

📌 5. Learn Java Web Development (Backend Development) with Spring Boot
Java Spring Boot is the most popular backend framework for full-stack Java developers.

🔹 Essential Spring Boot Topics:
Spring Boot Basics (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
REST APIs (Building Backend Services)
Spring Boot with JDBC & JPA (Hibernate)
Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth 2.0, Spring Security)
Microservices & API Gateways
✅ Recommended Resources:

Course: Spring Boot & Microservices on Udemy
Documentation: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot
📌 6. Learn Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js or Angular)
Full-stack developers must know frontend technologies.

🔹 Frontend Basics:
HTML & CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
JavaScript (ES6+) (DOM Manipulation, Promises, Fetch API)
🔹 Frontend Framework (React.js OR Angular)
React.js (Recommended) OR Angular
State Management (Redux for React, NgRx for Angular)
REST API Integration (fetch, axios, async/await)
✅ Recommended Resources:

GraphQL Course: GraphQL for Beginners
📌 8. Learn Deployment & DevOps (Cloud, Docker, CI/CD)
A full-stack developer must know how to deploy applications on the cloud.

🔹 Deployment Topics:
Hosting on AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean
Docker & Kubernetes (Containerization)
CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
✅ Recommended Resources:

AWS Free Tier Account (https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
Docker Docs (https://docs.docker.com/)
📌 9. Master Testing & Debugging (JUnit, Postman, Selenium)
Every developer should write tests to ensure the application works correctly.

🔹 Testing Topics:
Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito)
Integration Testing (Spring Test)
Frontend Testing (Jest, Selenium)
✅ Recommended Resources:

Testing Spring Boot Apps (Udemy, Pluralsight)
Postman API Testing Course (YouTube)
